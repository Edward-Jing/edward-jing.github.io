I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics at the University of California, Davis](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/), where I began my doctoral studies in March 2025 after completing my M.S. degree in the same department. I received my B.S. in Statistics from the [Department of Statistics and Data Science at Fudan University](https://www.fdsm.fudan.edu.cn/en/index.html)  in 2022. My undergraduate thesis was advised by [Professor Yin Xia](https://sites.google.com/view/yinxia), to whom I am deeply grateful for mentorship and guidance. In Fall 2019, I participated in the University of California Education Abroad Program (UCEAP) and spent a semester as an exchange student at UC Davis
