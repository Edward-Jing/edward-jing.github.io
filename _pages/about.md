I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at the University of California, Davis, where I began my doctoral studies in March 2025 after completing my M.S. degree in the same department. I received my B.S. in Statistics from the [Department of Statistics and Data Science at Fudan University](https://www.fdsm.fudan.edu.cn/en/Statistics.aspx) in 2022. My undergraduate thesis, *Dota2 Mid-line AI based on Deep Reinforcement Learning*, was advised by [Professor Yin Xia](https://www.fdsm.fudan.edu.cn/En/preview.html?UID=012108), to whom I am deeply grateful for mentorship and guidance.

In Fall 2019, I participated in the [University of California Education Abroad Program (UCEAP)](https://uceap.universityofcalifornia.edu/) and spent a semester as an exchange student at UC Davis.
